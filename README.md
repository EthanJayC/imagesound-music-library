# imagesound-music-library
A coding challenge submission.

Structure:
-The MusicLibraryApplication project contains the Music library (using an implementation of IMusicLibrary) with the method that returns a track of a chosen genre.
-This also contains the SQL query that'd be used in a real-time db.
-The RazorView within the pages folder is the HTML written frontend page that uses the List of music tracks to be displayed in the main body in the form of a table.

Unit tests:
A seperate project using XUnit tests, one file with each of the tests required in the specification
